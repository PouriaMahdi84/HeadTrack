# HeadTrack
This project enables hands-free control of the mouse cursor using real-time head movements captured via a webcam. By leveraging computer vision techniques and facial landmark detection, users can navigate their computer screen simply by moving their head â€” offering an innovative solution for accessibility, gaming, and gesture-based interfaces.
